// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a / 2 = b

ask for 1 number
divide number by 2
if answer is a whole number, it is even
else odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

PROVIDE NUMBERS a,b,c,d,e
(a+b+c+d+e)/5

provide 5 number
add 5 numbers
divide by 5 //total number of separate 
sort numbers smallest to largest
display smallest number with quote "smallest number entered"
display largest number with quote "largest number entered"
